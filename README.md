For my compute engine the computation I have picked is in relation to market analysis and investment strategies, and I have decided to do a Monte Carlo simulation for portfolio returns.  My Monte Carlo simulation will have a single integer input n as the number of simulated days/trials/random scenarios to approximate investment returns.  The expected output will be the expected portfolio return and standard deviation.
